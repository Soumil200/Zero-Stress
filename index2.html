    <h1> Is All Stress Bad? </h1>
  </center>
  <div class="box">
      <div class="box-title" >Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s what helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive, and it’s just as important in today’s world. It can be healthy when it helps you avoid an accident, meet a tight deadline, or keep your wits about you amid chaos.We all feel stressed at times, but what one person finds stressful may be very different from what another finds stressful. An example of this would be public speaking. Some love the thrill of it and others become paralyzed at the very thought.Stress isn’t always a bad thing, either. Your wedding day, for example, may be considered a good form of stress.</div>
      <br>
        <div class="box-title" >“Happiness is a choice. You can choose to be happy. There’s going to be stress in life, but it’s your choice whether you let it affect you or not.</div>
        <br>
          <div class="box-title" >”Physical Effects: Stress can lead to various physical symptoms, including increased heart rate, muscle tension, shallow breathing, and digestive problems. Prolonged stress can weaken the immune system and contribute to chronic health issues.Emotional Effects: Stress can also impact emotions, causing irritability, anxiety, depression, and mood swings. It may affect a person's ability to concentrate and make decisions.Individual Variability: It's important to note that what is stressful varies from person to person. What one person finds stressful, another may not, and people have different coping mechanisms.</div>
